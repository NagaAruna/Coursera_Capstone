Boston has 23 neighborhoods with various\nplaces that attract tourists and people to visit. Neighborhoods of Boston are different in terms of different factors that can\ndirectly or indirectly affect the success chance of business. It is important to evaluate those 23 neighborhoods based on the\nfactors that affect running a successful business such as the number of competitors, and the potential demand in each of the\nneighborhoods. Budget limitations in renting or buying a place also play an important role in this decision making especially for\nsmall businesses.\\\nIn this project, like to help to find the best neighborhood in Boston to open an Ice Cream shop. An ice cream shop is\ngood to be near a place where many people visit such as near a cinema, park, garden, playground, etc. Also, a neighborhood that has fewer competitors is less risky for starting a new\nbusiness."
